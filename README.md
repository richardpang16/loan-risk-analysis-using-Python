# Project Overview: Loan Application Analysis

## Objective
This project analyzes a loan application dataset to enhance understanding of application trends, borrower behaviors, and associated risks.

## Dataset Structure
- **Previous Application Dataset**: 1,670,214 rows, 37 columns.
- **Current Application Dataset**: 307,511 rows, 122 columns.
- **Combined Dataset**: 1,977,725 rows, 160 columns.

## Key Columns
- **TARGET**: 
  - 1 = Default clients
  - 2 = All other cases
- **Contract Status**: 
  - Approved, refused, canceled, and unused loan applications.

## Analysis Focus Areas
- **Factors Influencing Applications**: Impact of demographics and loan categories.
- **Occupation Trends**: Loan application trends across occupations.
- **Loan Type Variation**: Differences in applications by loan type.
- **Gender Influence**: Borrowing behavior by gender.
- **Family Structure**: Effects of family dynamics on applications.
- **Education Correlation**: Relationship between education level and approval rates.
- **Homeownership and Income Role**: Their influence on borrowing and eligibility.
- **Default Rates**: Correlation with borrower profiles.

## Key Findings
- Laborers and cash loans dominate applications.
- Females submit significantly more applications than males.
- Default rates correlate with the number of children and income levels.
- Education levels influence application volume and approval rates.

## Data Cleaning
- Cleaned datasets using Python for accurate analysis.

This project provides insights into the factors affecting loan applications, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
